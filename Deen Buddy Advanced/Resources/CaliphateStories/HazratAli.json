    "intro": "Ali ibn Abi Talib (RA) was a young boy, around 10 years old, when the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ received revelation from Allah through Jibreel (AS). The message of Tawheed (the Oneness of Allah) was revealed in a society filled with idol-worship, injustice, and corruption. The Prophet ﷺ first shared Islam quietly with those closest to him. Among the very first to believe was Ali (RA), the cousin and later son-in-law of the Prophet ﷺ, who had been raised in the Prophet’s own household. When the Prophet ﷺ invited him to Islam, Ali (RA) did not respond immediately. He was a child, and he said he wished to ask his father, Abu Talib. But that night, Allah opened his heart. The next morning, Ali (RA) returned and said he believed in Allah and His Messenger ﷺ. He accepted Islam without hesitation, without fear, and without delay.",
